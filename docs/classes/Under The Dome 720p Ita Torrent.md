## What Happened to Under the Dome Season 4?
 
Many fans of Under the Dome were disappointed when CBS announced that the show was canceled after its third season. The network stated that the show had a "planned conclusion" and that the finale would provide closure to the story. However, some viewers felt that the ending was rushed and unsatisfying, leaving many questions unanswered and plot holes unresolved.
 
So why did Under the Dome get canceled? There are several possible reasons, such as:

- Declining ratings. The show started strong in its first season, averaging 11.19 million viewers and a 2.7 rating in the 18-49 demographic. However, the ratings dropped significantly in the second and third seasons, reaching an average of 4.23 million viewers and a 0.8 rating in the final season.
- Negative reviews. The show received mixed to negative reviews from critics and audiences alike, who criticized the show's writing, acting, logic, and consistency. The show has a 38% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 66 reviews, with an average score of 5.3/10.
- Creative differences. The show underwent several changes in its production team, including the departure of its original creator and showrunner Brian K. Vaughan after the first season. The show also deviated significantly from the source material by Stephen King, adding new characters, subplots, and twists that were not well-received by some fans.

Despite its cancellation, Under the Dome still has a loyal fan base that hopes for a revival or a reboot of the show. Some fans have even launched online petitions and campaigns to save the show or demand a proper ending. However, there is no official confirmation or indication that Under the Dome will return for a fourth season or any other form of continuation.
