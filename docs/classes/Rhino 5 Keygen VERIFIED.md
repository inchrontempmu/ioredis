## Features of Rhino 5
 
Rhino 5 has many features that enable you to create complex and realistic 3D models with ease and accuracy. Some of these features are:
 
- **Uninhibited free-form 3D modeling tools**: Rhino 5 lets you create any shape you can imagine with its flexible and intuitive interface. You can use curves, surfaces, solids, meshes, or a combination of them to model anything from organic forms to industrial parts.
- **Accuracy**: Rhino 5 can handle large projects with extreme precision. You can work with any unit system, from millimeters to kilometers, and control the tolerance and resolution of your models. You can also use snaps, guides, grids, dimensions, and annotations to ensure accuracy and clarity.
- **Compatibility**: Rhino 5 can import and export over 30 file formats, including DWG, DXF, OBJ, STL, STEP, IGES, FBX, 3DS, and more. This means you can easily exchange data with other software and platforms. You can also use plug-ins to extend the functionality of Rhino 5 with additional tools and formats.
- **Rendering**: Rhino 5 has a built-in renderer that can produce high-quality images and animations of your models. You can also use third-party renderers such as Brazil[^1^], Penguin[^1^], or V-Ray to achieve photorealistic results.
- **Grasshopper**: Grasshopper[^1^] is a graphical algorithm editor that allows you to create generative designs with Rhino 5. You can use Grasshopper to create parametric models that respond to changes in inputs and variables. You can also use Grasshopper to automate tasks, optimize solutions, and explore possibilities.
